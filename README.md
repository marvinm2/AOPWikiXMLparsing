This repository contains the python script to extract data from the AOP-Wiki XML file, to support the paper "Introducing WikiPathways as a data-source to support Adverse Outcome Pathways for regulatory risk assessment of chemicals and nanomaterials.", creating a human-readable output file. Make sure that all file paths are set correctly to the HGNC gene name file, AOP Wiki XML and the location for the output file as well as the SPARQL queries. 

The AOP-Wiki provides quarterly downloads. The full AOP-Wiki XML files should be downloaded from: https://aopwiki.org/downloads

This script works on Python 3.5.
