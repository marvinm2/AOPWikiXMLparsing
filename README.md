This repository contains python scripts to extract data from the AOP-Wiki XML file.

The AOP-Wiki provides quarterly downloads. The full AOP-Wiki XML files can be downloaded from: https://aopwiki.org/downloads

Also, testing data will be added

This script works on Python 3.5 on Ubuntu, as the Windows terminal causes issues while running.
